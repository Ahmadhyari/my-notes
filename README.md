the first thing you should aware in developing is that you must be a wake for any error and don't ignore it even if it look very small or easy because maybe with time it will cause a many bugs in your projects and don’t forget that the main purpose of the software is to help people, if your  design is good then the software’s lifetime of your will be longer
 Understanding of our work is very important to make a good design and be a good developer , it's not important to show that you are smart as how much your work is simple to help programmers to understand it and for other developers 
And if you are instructed to say hi just say hi if you more unrequired things it will take more time and maybe lead to errors and complexity your project , it's important to maintenance the changes as important as implement
If your code is consistency then it will more easy to understand , you must manage your desirability of changes and what is the value of it and how much effort  it need, if you know how to deal with the problem for sure you will solve it , you should save your predictions of the future and deal with generality , don’t let changes on codes easy to do you should resist , Don’t be very depend on external technologies , every day and every problem will learn you something and if you need help just ask for it and don’t ask questions
